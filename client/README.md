Created a full stack chat application where user can create multiple rooms and talk to others. Other than sending messages users can also send images and emojis. chats are updated on realtime using pusher. Authentication is handled by firebase auth and users can login using their google account. Docker is used for containerising and deployed on heroku as a container.
